This is again a custom tool I created for repetative tasks I have to do at work.

The application contains a data grid which you can drag folders and subfolders into containing files you want to rename.

Then you can do bulk updates such as replace, insert or append to 'selected' filenames.

There is a select all option, or you can individually select which files to rename.

Clicking apply will not commit the changes, but show a preview of the new name.

Once all names are ready, select the files you want to commit changes to and click the 'RENAME' button.

Files will be renamed within the appropriate filepaths.

the newest version includes an undo button for a mistaken 'apply' NOT a commit.



Under the options tab, there is also a custom tool, where an excel file can be imported of old names versus new names.

For this, you add the files per usual, then click custom tools --> excel import, this changes the names and commits them.


There is also a reordering tool, once the order of files is set in your data grid, go to custom tools --> re-order.

Add a seperator if you desire and click 'GO'

The filenames will be reordered with a numerical value followed by the seperator character.

These will not be finalized 'commited' changes.

You must click RENAME to commit changes.
